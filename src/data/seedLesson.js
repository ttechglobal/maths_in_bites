  title: "Quadratic Equations",
  intro: "Ever wondered how architects decide the shape of a bridge, or how a phone calculates where your ball will land in a game? The secret is **quadratic equations**! Don't be scared — by the end of this lesson, you'll solve them like a pro. 🎯",
  concept: `A **quadratic equation** is any equation in the form:\n\n*ax² + bx + c = 0*\n\nwhere **a ≠ 0**. The highest power of x is 2, which is why it's called "quadratic" (from the Latin for *square*).\n\nThe three standard methods to solve quadratics are:\n1. **Factorisation** — splitting into two brackets\n2. **Completing the square** — rewriting in a perfect square form\n3. **Quadratic formula** — the all-powerful formula that always works!`,
